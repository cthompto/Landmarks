Landmarks 
Chelsea Thompto
2021 -

Landmarks is an exploration of the ways artificial intelligence, and specifically facial recognition, fails to comprehend trans bodies (misgendering) and the threat this failure possesses to trans livelihood as these technologies become increasingly integrated into our daily lives. The work consists of an interactive website featuring compositions that explore these issues.

Part of this exploration uses your webcam to display facial recognition outputs. Your data is not stored or shared during this process and the algorithm is not improved or modified based on your image. If you choose not to use your webcam, you can still see the text and layout of the site without the interactive visuals. This project is still in development and will eventually include a parallel version of the site using pre recorded video in place of live webcam feedback.
